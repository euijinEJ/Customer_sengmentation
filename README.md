# Customer Segmentation Analysis


## :card_index_dividers: About the Project

The project aims to identify useful customer segments in the reservations data, and then to visualize the segments in a way that could lead to actionable marketing insights.


The underlying questions are as follows:


Based on the analysis, how many different customer segments are there? What are the key characteristics of each segment?
What advice would you offer the executives of the company, based on the segmentation analysis, so they can better achieve their business objectives?
